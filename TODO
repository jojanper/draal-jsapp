- API post data validation
  - Hook https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator to API controller
- Move tests to components
- Manager methods: promisify
- Add celery to Docker configuration
- Missing user account funtionality
  - Password change
- File upload
- Add support for token based authentication
  - example project: https://scotch.io/tutorials/authenticate-a-node-js-api-with-json-web-tokens

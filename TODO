Some thoughts for further development:
--------------------------------------

- Missing user account funtionality
  - Password change
- File upload
- Add support for token based authentication
  - See links.md
- GraphQL
  - Only authenticated users allowed -> use middleware
  - Admin permission required to view users
- API validations
  - Serialize as part of API data
  - Generalize names:
    - exists -> required
  - Validation messages:
    - Option to show also input field instead of general message
- SocketIO permissions
  - See links.md
